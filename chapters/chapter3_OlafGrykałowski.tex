\begin{math}

I added some math equation:\newline
    
    H = -\sum p(x) log p(x) \newline
    
    A = \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{2}
    \\
\end{math}
\\
I added unordered list: \\

List of books:
\begin{itemize}

    \item[$\blacksquare$] The way of supiroir man 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] Why we sleep 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] How to win friends and influence people
    \item[$\blacksquare$] Unscripted
    
\end{itemize}
